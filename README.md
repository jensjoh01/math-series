# math-series
CF-401 Class 2

In this assignment John Jensen and Joseph Kim were paired partners. 

The purpose of this lab was to create a fibonocci, lucas, and sum_series function that returns the nth value of the series. This was to be done with TDD programming principles and each series needed to be tested.
